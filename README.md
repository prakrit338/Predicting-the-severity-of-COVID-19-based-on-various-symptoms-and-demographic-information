# COVID-19 Severity Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains code for predicting the severity of COVID-19 based on various symptoms and demographic information. The primary goal of this project is to analyze a dataset, preprocess it, and build a machine learning model for predicting the severity of COVID-19. We'll be implementing various preprocessing techniques and feature engineering strategies to prepare the data for model training.

## Dataset

We use a dataset containing information on symptoms, demographic details, and severity of COVID-19 cases. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned for analysis.

## Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature engineering to enhance predictive power

## Model Building

We use a Decision Tree Classifier for predicting the severity of COVID-19 cases based on the input features.
